Features

The Rules
To get the most out of this program, you MUST follow these 3 simple rules:
Rest: Take rest days as needed.
Reps: Every rep is a pause rep, following a 2-2-2 tempo (2 seconds down, 2 seconds pause, 2 seconds up).
Weight: Use the maximum weight that allows you to maintain good form.
The first and second set should be at 75% and 85% of your working weight used for the last two reps.
